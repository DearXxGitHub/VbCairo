# VbCairo
Cairo Graphics bindings for VB6

### Description

This repo contains a `stdcall` port of Cairo Graphics for use by VB6 projects. This build uses `/MT` and `/MTd` (static) runtimes and `Windows XP (v140_xp)` platform toolset in Visual Studio 2015 for the produced DLLs to be portable and self-contained.
